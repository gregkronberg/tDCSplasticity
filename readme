Model of synaptic integration in CA1 pyramidal neuron during DC stimulation.

This is a detailed biophysical model of a CA1 pyramidal neuron based on Migliore et al. 2005.  Synaptic conductances and learning rules are based on models from Kim et al. 2015 and Clopath et al. 2010, respectively.

Modules:
