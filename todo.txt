to do

-analysis module
	-add comments
	-detect peak voltage in a given section

-experiments
	-subthreshold integration
		-apply subthreshold inputs to different branches
		-apply an increasing number of simultaneous input
		-record somatic voltage
		-does dcs act independently on each branch?
			-if so, dcs effects should scale with the number of independent branches that are activated

	-sequences
		-See Branco and Hausser 2010 for motivation
		-branches amplify sequences due to gradient of impedence and dendritic nonlinearities
		-choose a dendritic branch and increase the discretization to ~20 segments.  apply sequences of inputs along the branch. sequences going from distal to proximal should be amplified. does dcs boost this amplification?


	- dendritic spike probability
		- does dcs enhance dendritic spike probability during poisson trains

	-tbs experiments

		- start by choosing a branch and study spike generation and plasticity in that branch. Are results influenced by 1 vs multiple branches?
		- detect spikes in each compartment and determine where they were initiated

		-set clopath parameters to same as in original paper
		-set up to save data and analyze using python later (voltage in all compartments, weights in all compartments, which synapses were activated
		)
		-run 100 simulations, randomly drawing the number of activated synapses from a gaussian (0.4 mean, 0.1 sd)


		-replicate asif's tbs experiments, including asymmetry
		-can asymmetry be explained by dendritic spiking? h-current?
		
		-replicate with 20V/m, then reduce intensity to see if effects are linear

		-randomly activate 40% of synapses and run TBS
		
		-choose parameters to fit
			-synaptic current
			-h-current and a-type potassium current
			-clopath rule: ltp/ltd thresholds, learning rate, time constants

		-reduce to two-compartment model
